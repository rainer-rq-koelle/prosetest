test - playing around with prose.io
Several online markdown editor tested for this file:

* [Dillinger](htttps://dillinger.io)
* [Prose](prose.io)
* [StackEdit](https://Stackedit.io/)



where are my changes gone?

Dillinger looks a bit cooler for online editing than prose.io. It offers a richter browser based interface with immediate preview ... if wanted

Editing is a breeze no overhead.
